# Tools

Example showcasing how to add a custom tool view

## Trying it out

Start local dev server:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Follow these steps to see the example in action:

1. Open http://localhost:5173/devenv/ if it wasn't automatically opened when starting the dev env
2. Open the "..." menu (you may need to click or hover the video for this button to appear), click on "My tool"
3. The custom tool view should now have been opened
4. The app also provides the same tool view in One-to-One, select either 1:1 Call Widget or 1:1 Agent Tool in top right corner
5. Open the "..." menu, click on "My tool"
6. The custom tool view should now have been opened
